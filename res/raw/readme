This software is a smart compass which points to the Bahá'í Qiblih (Point of Adoration, in our case the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh). No warranty whatsoever about its accuracy. It can only be as accurate as your magnetometer + satellite navigation device (GPS). To allow for best accuracy avoid using near ferromagnetic material (such as iron or steel). If your compass seems stuck, recalibrate your magnetometer by waving your handset in an 8-figure (check for details on the Internet).

Note that there are actually two ways to determine the bearing towards a point. The most used (which is the default) is the Great Circle (or orthodrome) which is a circle whose centre is the earth's centre. It is the shortest path on the surface of the Earth, and thus the "straight line" of spherical geometry, but consists of a curve on a map. The other possibility of defining a straight line is the Rhumb Line (or loxodrome). It is the line of constant bearing, or in simpler terms, the straight line on a Mercator-projected map (that's the map in which Europe is much bigger than Africa). This software allows for both options to be used, via the preferences menu. Note that a parallel (apart from the equator itself) is a Rhumb Line (you keep going east), but not a Great Circle (thus not the shortest path).
